# PortaVax

A GHP engineering project created by Sam Prausnitz-Weinbaum, William Li, Isabella Sun, and Joseph Oprea

Sub-saharan communities are undervaccinated. A large reason for this is the difficulty of delivering vaccines to these communities, because the vaccines must be kept in a cold, controlled environment until they are administered.
PortaVax is a solution to this problem: a small, autonomous vehicle that can keep vaccine doses cold and deliver them to communities in need.
